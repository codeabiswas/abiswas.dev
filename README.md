# Andrei Biswas (codeabiswas) Portfolio Website

This is my personal/portfolio website that I built using React. It pulls data all the data from a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/codeabiswas/ac0204d535a5b7b515c7ddfd8be5671e).

Feel free to use this site as a template to build your own website by forking this repository. Make sure to create a GitHub Gist like above and link it to your own site!

## To develop

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd abiswas.dev/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing**

    The site runs locally at http://localhost:8000

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see it update instantaneously.

## Project structure

- `.env.development`
  - This is a local file which contains the `GATSBY_NEXT_PUBLIC_PRI_GIST_API` variable. This variable is the `api.github.com` link to the gist above.
- `src/`
  - `assets/`
    - Favicon and downloadable objects
  - `components/`
    - Any reusable objects used throughout the site. Each folder within it follows the same format as written in `mkcomp` ([a Shell script](https://github.com/codeabiswas/mkcomp) I wrote to create React components in a sane format). If there is no custom styling, there is no `styled.js` associated with that component.
  - `pages/`
    - The pages user can navigate to in the site. Currently on `index.js` (landing page, which shows all the `sections/`) and `404.js`.
  - `scss/`
    - Only contains `index.scss` that the whole site uses. Only `index.js` should import it.
  - `sections/`
    - All the sections of the site
